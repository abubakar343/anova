# Anova Analysis

## Overview

**Stock Analysis** is a Python project designed for beginners to learn financial analysis and basic data science techniques. The project covers a range of topics from data manipulation and visualization to statistical analysis and machine learning. The code fetches and processes stock data and performs various analyses, including calculating and visualizing cumulative distribution functions, running linear regression models, and conducting ANOVA tests.

## Features

- **Data Manipulation**: Load and clean datasets from Excel and CSV files.
- **Visualization**: Generate Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) plots.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Calculate the correlation matrix for the dataset.
- **Linear Regression**: Fit linear regression models to predict stock data and evaluate model performance.
- **ANOVA Tests**: Conduct one-way ANOVA to compare groups based on different criteria.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - scipy
  - statsmodels

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-analysis.git
   cd stock-analysis
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have the necessary data files (`data1.xlsx`, `athlete_events.csv`) in the project directory.

## Usage

1. **Load and Explore Data**: The script loads data from an Excel file (`data1.xlsx`) and a CSV file (`athlete_events.csv`). It then provides options to inspect the first few rows of the dataset.

2. **ECDF Plotting**: Generate and visualize an ECDF plot of the 'Total' column from the dataset.

3. **Correlation Matrix**: Calculate and display the correlation matrix for the dataset to understand relationships between different variables.

4. **Linear Regression**: Fit a linear regression model to predict 'UnitCost' based on 'Total' and evaluate the model using R², intercept, and coefficients.

5. **ANOVA Testing**: Perform one-way ANOVA to compare weights across different teams or groups in the dataset.

6. **Advanced ANOVA**: Use `statsmodels` to perform more advanced ANOVA based on multiple factors (e.g., 'Sex' and 'Team').

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python stock_analysis.py
```

## Example

Here's a snippet showing how to run a simple linear regression:

```python
import stock_analysis as sa

# Load data
df = pd.read_excel('data1.xlsx')

# Fit a linear regression model
x = df['Total']
y = df['UnitCost']
ml_model = LinearRegression().fit(x, y)

# Check the model's score
print(ml_model.score(x, y))
```
